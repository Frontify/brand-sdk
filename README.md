## Frontify CLI

Frontify CLI allows developers to serve apps like Content Blocks in a local development environment. With the CLI, you can easily run and test your app without having to deploy it to Frontify's platform. The CLI also includes commands for building and deploying your app to Frontify's platform.

## App Bridge

App Bridge is a SDK that allows developers to interact with Frontify and integrate their app with Frontify's platform. The SDK includes methods for making requests to the Frontify API, handling authentication, and managing app data. With App Bridge, developers can access Frontify's platform features and functionality within their own app, providing a seamless user experience for Frontify users.

This package is essential for building apps like Content Blocks that integrate with Frontify's platform. The types and helpers included in this package ensure type safety and provide useful functions for working with Frontify's API and platform features.

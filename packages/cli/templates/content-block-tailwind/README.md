## Manifest Configuration

The `manifest.json` file is a crucial part of your app setup. It allows your app to control where it surfaces within the platform. Your app can appear in various locations such as the asset creation menu or the asset action menu.

Additionally, the `manifest.json` file enables you to specify the types of files your app can work with, such as images, audio files, specific formats like jpg, png, and more.

For detailed information on configuring the `manifest.json` file, please refer to our [documentation](https://developer.frontify.com/).
